1. Initialize the grid
 -> has width/height
 -> has a 2-d array filled of "Cell" objects
 -> helper method to take cursor position and return
    cell its inside of
 -> is_valid method to take (start_x,start_y, end_x,end_y)
   and return True or False depending on if this is a valid move
    [it could instead be (cell, end_x,end_y)] and end_x,end_y
    is converted to a cell object of course


2. Upon a cell being clicked, highlight the valid places it can be dragged to
this uses the class ShowValidMoves which when initializes takes in a cell and the grid object as well

[Optional] Have an option for cells where a key can be pressed 
and it will highlight all cells that have valid moves







probably want position as a tuple rather than
separately passing in x and y as different parameters
