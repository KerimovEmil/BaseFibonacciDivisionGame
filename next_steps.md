## Next Steps: 

Tutorial 
-> Screenshots are displayed which show various moves
that can be made within the game

Highlight Possible Moves on Cell being Clicked
 -> HighlightMoves/ShowValid Moves class
 -> display cells that the cell can move into

### Update Design
Refined Tiles
-> Refined tiles(images) for cells in place of the rectangle
-> See 2048 and others as a design reference of sorts

Difficulty modifies the Grid Size or Problem Selection otherwise

### Move Log:
-> Collapsible Log/Panel that after a move is made, shows 
-> This may not be very useful

### Different Rule Sets/Sequences
-> The use of base fibonacci presents 4 clear rules for conversions.
But what about if the bases and the rules are different? Allow for injection of different rules to change up the game format.

### Solution
* Calculate the Optimal Path (Smallest Number of Moves) to reach the solution

* Show a Visualization of the Solution
    * Automatically 


* Try and deploy within a python environment in a live site somehow. Perhaps in a self-contained container where user clicks/actions can be registered properly.
